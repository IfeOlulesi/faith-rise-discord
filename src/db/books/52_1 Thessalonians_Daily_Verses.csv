1,1,"For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance in unto you was not in vain:"
1,3,"Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;"
2,17,"But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire."
3,10,"Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?"
4,11,"And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;"
5,18,"In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you."
